Introduction
Welcome to Figma, the world's first collaborative interface design tool. Figma allows designers to create and prototype their digital experiences - together in real-time and in one place - helping them turn their ideas and visions into products, faster. Figma's mission is to make design accessible to everyone. The Figma API is one of the ways we aim to do that.

What can I do with the Figma API?
The Figma API supports access and interactions with Figma's different products. This gives you the ability to do things such as view and extract any objects or layers, and their properties from files, get usage data, or listen for events with webhooks, among other things.

How does it work?
The Figma API is based on the REST structure. We support authentication via access tokens and OAuth2. Requests are made via HTTP endpoints with clear functions and appropriate response codes. Endpoints allow you to perform a number of actions:

Make requests for different resources:
Files
Images
File versions
Users
Comments
Projects
Components and styles
Work with variables
Manage dev resources
Get usage and analytics data:
Activity logs
Text events
Library analytics
Create and manage webhooks
Once granted access, you can use the Figma API to inspect a JSON representation of the file. Every layer or object in a file will be represented within the file by a node (subtree). You will then be able to access and isolate the object and any properties associated with it. In addition to accessing files and layers, you will be able to GET and POST comments to files.

Base URL
All REST API endpoints use the same base URL: https://api.figma.com

For example: GET https://api.figma.com/v1/files/:key

For Figma for Government, the base URL is: https://api.figma-gov.com

For example: GET https://api.figma-gov.com/v1/activity_logs

Note: The REST API documentation for endpoints generally refers to the common base URL, https://api.figma.com. If you're a Figma for Government customer, replace the common base URL with the Figma for Government version.

Getting started
If you’re not already using Figma, the first step is to sign up and create an account.

Once you have a Figma account, the next step is to authenticate with the API. This can be done using either OAuth2 or access tokens.

You can then browse our endpoints and start making queries against the Figma API. We recommend starting with the basics by learning about Figma files, before moving on to more advanced topics such as comments, users, version history, and projects.

If you plan on building a fully-fledged app, that others can share and use, then you can register your app by heading to My apps in your Figma account.

OpenAPI specification
The Figma REST API is fully described in an OpenAPI specification in the open source figma/rest-api-spec repository.

OpenAPI is a specification for describing HTTP APIs in a language-agnostic manner. It has a large ecosystem of tools to let you generate API documentation, client SDKs, and more. We also provide custom Typescript types generated from the OpenAPI specification for those of you with Typescript codebases to make it easy to write type-safe code out of the box. For more information, see the README.
